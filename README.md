## GML 3.2 (ISO 19136:2007) Conformance Test Suite

### Scope

This test suite checks GML 3.2 application schemas and data sets for conformance to 
ISO 19136:2007, _Geographic information -- Geography Markup Language_ (also published 
as [OGC 07-036](http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=20509)).
The essential purpose of the test suite is to validate a GML application schema 
or an instance document; both types of resources are referenced by URI. The 
application schema can be accessed from a variety of sources, such as a Web 
Feature Service (by means of a DescribeFeatureType request) or a catalogue 
service.
